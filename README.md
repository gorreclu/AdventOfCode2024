# Advent of Code Solutions ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This project contains my solutions for the annual Advent of Code programming challenge. Advent of Code is a fun and challenging way to practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking during the holiday season.

## ðŸŒŸ What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th. Each day, participants solve a unique puzzle, often involving:
- Parsing input data.
- Implementing algorithms.

Every puzzle is divided into two parts:
1. Solve the first problem to unlock the second.
2. Each part earns a **star**. Collect stars to complete your Advent calendar and save Christmas!
